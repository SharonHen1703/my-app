# Pull Request: Root Hygiene Cleanup

## Title
**chore(root): root hygiene (move scripts/reports, remove temp & secrets)**

## Description

This PR implements comprehensive root directory hygiene improvements as planned in the root audit. The changes organize project structure, enhance security, and prevent future clutter while maintaining full functionality.

## What Moved

### Scripts ‚Üí `tools/`
- `analyze_files.sh` - File analysis tooling
- `analyze_server.sh` - Server analysis tooling  
- `consistency_check.sh` - Data consistency validation
- `convert_sql.py` - SQL conversion utility
- `final_report.sh` - Report generation tooling
- `generate_report.sh` - Report generation tooling

### Reports/Artifacts ‚Üí `docs/reports/`
- `analysis.csv` - File analysis results
- `bids_dao_refactoring_report.md` - Refactoring documentation
- `circular_deps_removal_report.txt` - Dependency analysis
- `class_decomposition_report.md` - Architecture analysis  
- `server_analysis.csv` - Server analysis results
- `server_files.txt` - File inventory report

## What Deleted

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security-Critical Removals:**
- `cookie.txt` - Contained authentication cookies
- `cookies.txt` - Contained JWT auth tokens (HIGH RISK)
- `cookies_new.txt` - Duplicate auth cookie file
- `login_response.txt` - Contained curl debug output with potential sensitive data

**Cleanup Removals:**
- `rescue_staged.patch` - Empty patch file (0 bytes)
- `rescue_working.patch` - Empty patch file (0 bytes)
- `server_debug.log` - Build/debug log (untracked, removed from filesystem)

## .gitignore Additions

Added comprehensive root hygiene rules to prevent future accumulation:

```gitignore
# Root hygiene
/*.log
/*.csv  
/*.txt
/*.patch
/cookie*.txt
/login_response.txt

# Keep essential files and tracked dirs
!README.md
!LICENSE*
!docs/**
!tools/**
!server/**
!client/**
```

## Build Status

‚úÖ **GREEN** - No functional changes
- Server compilation: ‚úÖ PASS
- All tests: ‚úÖ PASS
- No code modifications
- Client folder completely excluded

## Security Impact

üîí **SECURITY IMPROVEMENT**: Removes exposed JWT authentication tokens from version control that were previously committed. This addresses a critical security vulnerability.

## Risk Assessment

**Risk Level: MINIMAL**
- Only organizational and security cleanup changes
- No source code, build configuration, or dependency modifications
- All valuable artifacts preserved via organized relocation
- Comprehensive safety validation performed

## Future Benefits

1. **Organized Structure**: Clear separation of tooling, documentation, and source code
2. **Security**: No more authentication tokens in version control
3. **Clean Root**: Professional project appearance for submission
4. **Automation**: .gitignore prevents future clutter accumulation
